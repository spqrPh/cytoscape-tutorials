		<h3>Filter Interactions</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Your network contains a combination of protein-protein (pp) and protein-DNA (pd) interactions. 
				Next, we will filter out the protein-protein interactions to focus on the protein-DNA interactions.</li>

			<li>First, let's select all protein-protein interactions.</li>
			<div class="cybrowser">
				<input type="button" class="btn btn-primary" onclick="cybrowser.executeCyCommand('network select edgeList=interaction:pp');" value="Select p-p interactions"/>
			</div>
			<div class="not-cybrowser">
				<ul>
					<li>Go to the <b>Select</b> tab in the Cytoscape Control Panel (the leftmost panel).</li>
					<li>Click on the <b>+</b> and create a <b>Column Filter</b>.</li>
					<li>Click on <b>Choose column...</b> and select <b>Edge: interaction</b></li>
					<li>Now in the text field enter <b>pp</b>. This will select all of the edges with the protein-protein interactions.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<li>You should now see many edges in the network selected (i.e., colored red).</li>

	<h3>Observe the Network</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Notice that three dark red (highly induced) nodes are in the same region of the graph.</li>
		<li>Notice that there are two nodes that interact with all three red nodes: GAL4 (YPL248C) and GAL11 (YOL051W).</li>
		<li>Let's select these two nodes and their immediate neighbors.</li>
		<div class="cybrowser">
            <input type="button" class="btn btn-primary" onclick="cybrowser.executeCyCommand('network select nodeList=&quot;YPL248C,YOL051W&quot;');" value="Select GAL4 and GAL11"/>
			<input type="button" class="btn btn-primary" onclick="cybrowser.executeCyCommand('network select firstNeighbors=any network=current');" value="Select first neighbors"/><br />
		</div>
		<div class="not-cybrowser">
			<ul>
				<li>First select GAL4 (YPL248C) by clicking on it.</li>
				<li>Now, extend the selection by holding down the shift key and clicking on GAL11 (YOL051W).</li>
				<li>Finally, select their neighbors by control-6 (or &#8984;-6 on a Mac), or by the menu <b>Select &rarr; Nodes &rarr; First Neighbors of Selected Nodes &rarr; Undirected</b></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<li>It is sometimes useful to create a new network from selected nodes.</li>
		<div class="cybrowser">
			<input type="button" class="btn btn-primary" onclick="cybrowser.executeCyCommand('network create  excludeEdges=false networkName=subnetwork nodeList=selected source=current');" value="Create new network"/>

		</div> 
		<div class="not-cybrowser">
			<ul>
				<li>Create a new network by selecting <b>File &rarr; New &rarr; Network &rarr; Selected nodes, all edges</b>.</li>
				<ul>
					<li>(Even though we say all edges, only the

<h3>Exploring Nodes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Right click on the node GAL4.</li>
<li>Select the menu <b>External Links → Sequences and Proteins → Entrez Gene</b>.</li>
<li>This action will pop-up a browser window and search the Entrez Gene database for the term "YPL248C", the id of the node.</li>
<li>In the results in the browser the first entry should be labeled GAL4. Click on this entry.</li>
<li>The description of GAL4 tells us that it is repressed by GAL80.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our data show precisely this:</p>
    <ul>
	<li>Both nodes (GAL4 and GAL11) show fairly small changes in expression, and neither change is statistically significant: they are rendered as light-colored circles. These slight changes in expression suggest that the critical change affecting the black nodes might be somewhere else in the network, and not either of these nodes.</li>
	<li>GAL4 interacts with GAL80 (YML051W), which shows a significant level of repression: it is depicted as a red square.</li>
	<li>Note that while GAL80 shows evidence of significant repression, most nodes interacting with GAL4 show significant levels of induction: they are rendered as green squares.</li>
	<li>GAL11 is a general transcription co-factor with many interactions.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Putting all of this together, we see that the transcriptional activation activity of Gal4 is repressed by Gal80. So, repression of Gal80 increases the transcriptional activation activity of Gal4. Even though the expression of Gal4 itself did not change much, the Gal4 transcripts were much more likely to be active transcription factors when Gal80 was repressed. This explains why there is so much up-regulation in the vicinity of Gal4.</p>
