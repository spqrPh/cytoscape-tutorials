	<h1>Filtering and Editing</h1>
	<p>This tutorial will introduce you to some techniques for filtering and editing a network in Cytoscape:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apply filters to remove low-confidence edges.</li>
        <li>Perform basic network edits.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>For this tutorial, we will use a published dataset, which represents a portion of a human interaction data set published by <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867405008664" target="_blank">Stelzl et al.</a></p>
    <div class="cybrowser">
    <p>The tutorial is designed to run as a demo in the CyBrowser app, with interactive buttons for each task.</p>

<h1>Filtering the network for high-confidence interactions</h1>
    <p>The interactions in your network have evidence from varying sources: high-confidence yeast two-hybrid interactions(LacZ4) and low-confidence yeast two-hybrid interactions(SD4), coAP and GST pull-down interactions (GST_PullDown), and supporting evidence of interaction reported in literature. Verify this by examining the edge types in the <b>Edge Table</b>. Let's use Cytoscape's filters to view only interactions from high-confidence yeast two-hybrid interactions (LacZ4) experiments.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click on the <b>Select</b> tab of the <b>Control Panel</b>.</li>
        <li>Click on the drop-down to the right and select <b>Create New Filter</b>. Enter a name for your filter, for example "high-confidence".</li>
        <li>Click the + (add) button and select <b>Column Filter</b>. In the <b>Choose column...</b> drop-down, select "Edge:interaction".</li>
        <li>In the second drop-down, select "is" and type "LacZ4" in the text box.</li>

<p>The filter will be automatically applied. At the bottom of the <b>Select</b> tab, you can see how many edges/nodes where selected. A set of 2023 edges have been selected in your network. Your network should now look like this:</p>

    <p>Compared to the network you started with, the new network has fewer edges, but all the edges are determined through higher-confidence experimentation. For some types of analysis, this is a more appropriate set of edges.</p>

<h1>Choosing nodes based on adjacent nodes</h1>
    <p>It is sometimes useful to select a node or edge based on properties of the nodes it connects to, as opposed to the properties of the node or an edge itself. For the sake of illustration, the STELZL data has a column tagging a node as "suspicious", as judged from analysis outside of Cytoscape. In this tutorial, we will:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Identify all non-suspicious nodes and any nodes they connect to.</li>
        <li>Remove any suspicious nodes that are connected to less than 5 nodes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Remove sparsley connected suspicious nodes</h2>
    <p>We now have a network that includes both types of nodes. We will now create a new filter to remove all suspicious nodes that connect to fewer than five nodes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>In the <b>Select</b> tab, create a new filter and name it "Eliminate sparse suspicious nodes".</li>
        <li>Add a <b>Column Filter</b> for "Node:Suspicious" and choose "true".</li>
        <li>Add a <b>Degree Filter</b>. Set the range to between 0 and 4.</li>
        <li>To remove the selected nodes, select <b>Edit &rarr; Delete Selected Nodes and Edges...</b>.</li>
        <li>Finally, we need to remove any unconnected nodes that remain after the filters. Setup a <b>Degree Filter</b> with a range from 0 to 0. This selects all unconnected nodes. Delete the selected nodes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The new network has only non-suspicious nodes and suspicious nodes that connect to 5 or more nodes.</p>

    <h1>Editing</h1>
    <p>Sometimes it can be very useful to modify a network slightly, to add or remove nodes or edges. For instance, if you have prior knowledge of some biological process, you might want to add some nodes for proteins that you know are involved in a particular process, but that don't appear in your data set. <br />All network editing functions are available in a right-click context menu in the <b>Network View Window</b>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To add a node, right-click anywhere in the <b>Network View Window</b> and select <b>Add &rarr; Node</b>.</li>
        <li>Select the node with your mouse. In the <b>Node Table</b>, you should see a node with the shared name Node 1.</li>
        <li>Give your new node a name by clicking on the entry in the <b>Node Table</b>, and entering a name under the column <b>Official HUGO Symbol</b>.</li>
        <li>To add an edge to the node, right-click on the node and choose <b>Edit &rarr; Add Edge</b>. Drag the end of the newly created edge to another node in the network, and click to attach it.</li>
    </ul>
        <p>It is also possible to add nodes and interactions in sif format.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Locate the CPNE6 gene using the <b>Search</b> interface. Note the gene ID; 9362.</li>
        <li>We are going to add a known interaction between CPNE6 and GRB7 (Entrez ID 2886). With the CPNE6 gene in focus (not selected), right-click anywhere in the <b>Network View Window</b> and select <b>Add &rarr; Edge (and possibly Nodes) using SIF....</b></li>
        <li>In the <b>SIF Interpreter</b> dialog, enter "2886 interacts 9362" and click <b>OK</b>. You should see the new node with id 2886 connected to CPNE6.</li>
    </ul>
